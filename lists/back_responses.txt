Welcome back, {user}!
Heyyyyy we were wondering what happened to you {user}!
Oh shit, {user}'s back, shhhhhh!
Front!
Side to side!
Hey, did you bring us candy {user}?
Glad you came back {user}
Kcab!
I knew you'd come back, they always come back.
Earning those hours! Hell yeah!
Lurk Mode: Disengaged!
Hell yeah, party can resume!
Whew, thought you forgot about us!
Thought you got lost {user}!
Guess those breadcrumbs got you back, afterall.
Did you use the North Star to find your way back?
Did you ever really leave?
In another dimension, you never left... Think about that.
Of all the places you could be, glad you're here!
