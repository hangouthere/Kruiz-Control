Have sweet dreams, n all those things @{user}!
Goodnight @{user}, don't let the bed bugs bite!
Hope you dream about The Hangout, @{user}... It's not weird, trust me!
Sometimes I lay awake at night wondering if you're thinking about The Hangout like we're thinking about @{user}...
Night @{user}! The faster you go to sleep, the sooner you can wake up and say Good Morning!
@{user} is retiring to their slumber. Wish them well!
@{user} is going to curl up under the blankets and pass out!
Goodnight @{user}, remember to close your eyes and mouth at the same time, then you'll fall asleep!
Be sure to set your alarm, @{user}! Goodnight!
