Ideas:

* Color lightup not working
* Fix shoutout to not show clips if there aren't any!
* Auto fadeout and set about:blank to shoutout browser source
* Create a `!raid` command that will do a shoutout, and initiate a raid
* Create a `!randomRaid` that will randomly pick someone I'm following, that's also streaming in the same category, and raid them.
  * If no one is streaming, tell me...
